<p>Mark all files served from the CDN to expire in the far future (decades from now). This is the same as telling browsers to <em>always</em> use the cached files. This can significantly speed up page loads. Files are also automatically compressed (when the browser supports it), to speed up page loads even further.</p>
<p>Of course, you still want visitors to immediately get new versions of files when they change. That is why unique filenames are generated automatically.</p>
<p><strong>For the experts:</strong> the following HTTP headers are set: <tt>Expires</tt>, <tt>Cache-Control</tt>, <tt>Last-Modified</tt>, <tt>Vary</tt>, for files with one of the following extensions: !extensions and of these extensions, some will also be automatically compressed: !extensions-compressed.</p>
